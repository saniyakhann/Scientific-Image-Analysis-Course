# Scientific-Image-Analysis-Course

This project delivers an automated Python-based pipeline for lateral flow test interpretation, processing smartphone images through quality assessment, background removal, red-channel enhancement, region cropping, and peak detection. The system classifies results as Positive, Negative, or Void with confidence scores, providing annotated visualisations. Testing on 13 LFT images showed reliable performance with scores consistently above 70%. Visualisations through bar charts and scatter plots effectively demonstrated result distributions and confidence levels; as well as the average runtime displayed through a pie chart for performance analysis. This approach offers a scalable alternative to error-prone manual interpretation for rapid diagnostics. Future work could address varied test designs, implement adaptive color detection, and incorporate machine learning for enhanced versatility.
